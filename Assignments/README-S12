Assignment 12:

Assignment A:
	Download this TINY IMAGENET link (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip) dataset. 
	Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
Assignment B:
	Download 50 images of dogs. 
	Use this link http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via_demo.html to annotate bounding boxes around the dogs.
	Download JSON file. 
	Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work). 
	Find out the best total numbers of clusters.
	
1. created a utility method that will split the dataset in to train and test. 

2. Written custom Dataset class and overwritten len and get_item methods. Converted all greay scale image to RGB. 

3. All dataset goes through transformations including normalization

4. Changed Resnet18 a little and used F.adaptive_average_pool2d in place avgpool2d.

5. Got more than 51 % accuracy.

For Assignment B, Calculated all normalized centroids of the bounding box rectangle(In this exercise, shape is limited to rectangle).

Plotted those centroids using k Means and verified with K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-7. I feel K=3 is reasonable for this dataset.
