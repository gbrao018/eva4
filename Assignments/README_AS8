Assignment:

Refer Assignment7, we used depthwise separable convolutions, dilated convolution with 3.5 lac params and achived 78% accuracy.

In this Assignment 8, Now we replaced the last model with Resnet18 model and achived 88.2% percent accuracy. 

Used Randomclip and Random horizontal flip in transformation. Initially set LAMBDA =0.00001. In 40 epochs we got 86.9% .
 
later introduced Lr scheduler and LAMDA changed to 0.0001 and in 80 epochs we got 88.2 %. Could not see substantial improvement.

Another thing observed is overfitting. Hopefully , applying dropout can bring down this overfitting.

So observation is that Resnet18 gave higher accuracy, but with higher parameters. 
Where accuracy is needed, Resnet18 did good. If the compute resources are constraint we can go for inception, depthwise and dilated convolutions.
