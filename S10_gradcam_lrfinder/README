Assignment-10

	Used Albumentations for image augmentation with resnet18 model. 
	Applied Resize, Randomcrop, HorizontalFlip,VerticalFlip and Rotate and Cut out. dropout = 0.04, L1 and L2 with Lambda = 0.0004 applied.
    We used ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler with patience = 2 and with SGD as optimizer. 
	We drawn the LRFinder range test and identified  lr as 0.01 is good to choose.
	We are able to achieve the accuracy of 88.34 in 50 epochs but underfitting and better model.

	Used GradCam and displayed 30 incorrect samples and heat maps.
