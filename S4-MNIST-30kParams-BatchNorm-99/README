# Batch Normalization

Assignment-2/Session4 Tril1: 1 lac params, No Batch Normalization

Reduced the params to one lac. Kernel count from 4,8,16,32
Got the accuracy of 99.38%
Trial2: Used Batch Normalization

This time reduced the params to 27000
Used 4,8,16,32 kernel counts
Used batch normalization .. conv->relu->batchNorm
Got the accuracy of 99.35%

Trial 3: With Batch Normalization

This time tried with less than 16000
used kernel counts 8,16,32
Got 99.35% accuracy
