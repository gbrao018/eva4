# Batch Normalization

Assignment5 Goal: Achieve 99.4% accuracy on test data consistently with less than 10000 parameters and below 15 epochs and with minimum 5 steps

Step#1: (S5_BaseModel.ipynb)

Target . Create a base model which is working with in less than 10000 parameters
Result . Parameters 9790 . Best Accuracy on training set 98.17 . Best Accuracy on Test set 98.92
Analysis . Seems a good Model. . No overfitting as of now . Still there is a scope to improve . In the next step we will apply batch normalization to improve the accuracy

Step#2: (S5_step2_batchnorm.ipynb)

Target . Apply Batch Normalization and observe the model fit and accuracy improvement
Result . Parameters 9950 . Best Training accuracy 99.43 . Best Test Accuracy 99.11
Analysis . This shows overfitting . Training accuracy reached 99.43 , but test accuracy has not reached. We need to solve this overfitting issue. Next step we will add regularization/drop out to remove overfitting

Step#3: (S5_step3_regularization.ipynb)

Target . Apply Regularization/dropout to remove the overfitting
Result . parameters 9950 . Best Training set accuracy 98.79 . Best Test set accuracy 99.12
Analysis . Regularization worked and solved the overfitting issue. . But still last big kernel exist and Gap layer has not been used yet. We will add gap layer in next step

Step#4: (S5_step4_MaxPool5_Gaplayer_LastLayer.ipynb)

Target . Added gap layer and removed big kernel in the last. . As MNIST data shows features after receiptive field 5. Maxpool applied at receptive field 5 . Added additional layer after GAP layer
Result . Parameters 9932 . Best Training set accuracy 98.98 . Best Test set accuracy 99.40 . We are able to see the 99.4 accuracy but not consistently
Analysis . Test accuracy improved. . Model is NOT overfit and is good. . But there exist difference in the traing and test accuracy.Model is good and underfit . As MNIST shows some images shows some orientation, we will add orientation 7 degree in the next step.

Step#5: (S5_9k_noLR_9940.ipynb, S5_step5_final.ipynb)

Target
. Image Augmentation - Added 7 degree orientation as some images are oriented . Test with different models for consistency
Result . Paramters 9918 . Best Training Accuracy 98.9 . Best Test Accuracy 99.45 showed consistency in multiple models . At this stage tried with multiple models with below 10000 params. Got the consistency. (S5_9k_noLR_9940.ipynb, S5_step5_final.ipynb)
Analysis . Test data has few images which are oriented. . Model is underfitting . By adding few more paramaters and few additional epochs we can achieve the the consistent accuracy of more than 99.4 . Tried adding lr scheduler but could not gain more accuracy.
