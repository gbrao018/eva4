#Depthwise and Point wise convolution

Assignment7 :Run this network (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qlewMtxcAJT6fIJdmMh8pSf2e-dh51Rw).
Fix the network above: Change the code such that it uses GPU change the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs) total RF must be more than 44 one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional) achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M.

Solution Tried:

Fixed the network, with 3.5 lac params. With RF 48, L1-MP->L2->MP->L3->MP->GAP-0. Except Gap and after, Every layer used Depthwise and Point wise convolution.
First level run tried for 100 epocs without Regularization and with learning rate=0.01. 
But Training accuracy started increasing and at one level test accuracy came down. Test accuracy did not move beyond 70%.
Applied BatchNormalization. dropout to 0.1 and 0.2 still could not see much difference.
Reduced the learning rate to 0.001. And did some data transformation with RandomCrop. Ran for 150 epochs, Could able to reach till 78%.
