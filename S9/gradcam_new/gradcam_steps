Steps: 

Load a pre-trained model
Load an image which can be processed by this model (224x224 for VGG16 why?)
Infer the image and get the topmost class index
Take the output of the final convolutional layer
Compute the gradient of the class output value w.r.t to L feature maps
Pool the gradients over all the axes leaving out the channel dimension
Weigh the output feature map with the computed gradients (+ve)
Average the weighted feature maps along channels
Normalize the heat map to make the values between 0 and 1
